	Experience Review:
	    In terms of changes we may have wanted to make, our methodology for checking for cyclic
	references is not organized as well as we would like to. Some of our cyclic reference checking
	is done in the Cell,
	while some of it is done in the Worksheet. As a result, it is not entirely clear whether some
	of it is redundant. We also wish we had been able to use the trackpad gestures in order to
	operate infinite scrolling. As is, we can only use the scrollbars, and this is not immediately
	apparent to the user upon running our BeyondGood implementation. We learned from our provider
	code a different, more bottom up approach to building the WorksheetView that perhaps provides
	a bit more flexibility in terms of the structure of the code. This may have come in handy at
	various points during implementing our view, in particular when it came to editing cells
	without using the edit bar at the top of the Worksheet. With JTable, we had to disable
    this built in functionality and then rebuild it in our image. For our providers, they
	built it themselves from the start, and this likely saved them time.
        Our experience with our providers was fairly positive. Though we had some problems with the
    way they chose to implement their code, especially with regard to their controller, they were
    respectful and professional. They were also responsive when we asked for further code, and got
    the starter code to us very early. In general, a lot of communication wasnâ€™t needed in order to
    the assignment, however. They deserve nothing short of top marks.
