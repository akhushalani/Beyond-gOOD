        We were able to get all of the features working properly. Cell selection, Cell confirmation,
    Cell rejection, and the addition of rows and columns are all functional in our implementation
    of the Provider view.

    When testing the provider view, to confirm cells, you must remove the equals sign from the
    beginning of the formula, or the view will not work. We talk about this more extensively in our
    code critique.
